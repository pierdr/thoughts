<p><em>This is the track for a talk that I gave at the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design in 2018 about art, technology and complexity</em></p>

<p>The fathers of computation promised us that computers will become tools for augmenting human intellect, but seventy years later we are still spending our evenings looking for that coupon, forgetting to book that on-demand laundry service, or feeling that we are missing out on that visit to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Ice_Cream">museum of ice cream </a> that all our friends are posting on their walls.</p>
<p>The interfaces that are presented on our digital devices tend to be most of the time humorless, inexorably predictable, and sometimes austere, and this is just one symptom of the direction that our current digital culture has taken.</p>
<p>In this talk we will explore how the convergence of natural and synthetic systems can push the thinking around interfaces, devices, memes; connecting broccoli, colonies, and LEDs.</p>
<p>Pierluigi is a senior experience designer based in San Francisco, where he works at the intersection between the natural and the technological, speculating about the future of education, human senses, and automobiles.</p>

<h3>Artist statment:</h3>
<p>As an art futurist, I envision a world where the creative process is fueled by molecules of unconstrained design, allowing artists to explore boundless possibilities via open technologies with a hacking mantra. Designing with an unconstrained eye, we delve into the lessons from the unconstrained, embracing chaotic systems that give birth to serendipitous design. Our approach combines the wisdom of human creativity and the collaborative power of algorithms, co-designing and collaborating to unlock new frontiers. In this realm of amorphous design, we embrace the unexpected, finding inspiration in the interplay between art and technology. With design-inspired serendipity, we chart a path where humans and algorithms come together, harnessing the potential of unconstrained thinking to shape a future where art transcends limitations and propels us into uncharted artistic realms.</p>

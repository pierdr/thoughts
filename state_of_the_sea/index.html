<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
An account of my experiences sailing over 800 nautical miles in various waters, observing both the beauty and concerning state of our oceans.</p>
<p>I talk about the extensive oil spill near Santa Barbara, California, the widespread of marine mucilage in the Adriatic Sea, the proliferation of luxury yachts and the the prevalence of gas-guzzling motorboats and cruise ships, particularly in beautiful locations like the Amalfi coast.
A reflect on the modern disconnect between the sea goers and nature and a concern report about the impact of human activities on marine ecosystems, including pollution, overfishing, and climate change. The article wants to be a call for readers to consider their environmental impact in daily choices and travel decisions.</p>

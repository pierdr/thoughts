<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
Collective computing seeks to bridge the gap between our collaborative nature and digital interfaces by exploring how technology can enhance co-present work and interaction. This approach challenges the dominance of personal computing, drawing inspiration from early collaborative interfaces like Doug Engelbart's &quot;Mother of All Demos&quot; and innovative projects like SandboxVR and Dynamicland. Researchers are developing systems that blend physical and digital realms, allowing multiple users to interact simultaneously in shared spaces. Key principles for these collective interfaces include non-hierarchical design, task-lessness (supporting unstructured use), and whole-body interaction. The goal is to create computational paradigms that seamlessly integrate into collaborative environments, supporting natural social dynamics rather than interrupting them. By moving beyond traditional screen-based interactions, collective computing aims to leverage the full expressive potential of human bodies and physical spaces, ultimately enhancing our ability to work together and potentially reconnecting us with our inherently collaborative nature.</p>

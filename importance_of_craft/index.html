<p>The article emphasizes the importance of craft in interaction design, which involves expressing ideas in four dimensions: space and <em>time</em>, but time for an interaction designer is about behavior and interactivity. The article suggests that mastering the craft it's like painting with a combination of animation, cognitive ergonomics, computational thinking, and computational practice to create usable and delightful experiences. Understanding code and computational thinking enables designers to fully harness the dynamic nature of the digital medium and express ideas with the richness of interactivity.</p>
<p>While underappreciated in the educational context, the ability to concepting and expression of ideas in the dynamic medium of computation is important for students that are starting their path into this practice.</p>

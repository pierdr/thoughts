<b>Abstract:</b><br>
The conventional approach to designing emerging technologies revolves around getting deep into the tecnicalities and potential of the technologies. Our approach instead emphasizes the role of narrative and culture in shaping technological adoption. Popular imagination, fueled by media and corporate narratives, significantly influences which technologies emerge. The course equips students to critically analyze these narratives and create design concepts that embody their values, rather than following external trends. Students are encouraged to consider long-term implications and unintended consequences, moving beyond simplistic futurism. Projects ranged from ambient computing devices to material innovations and AI companions, all adhering to principles of sustainability and user-centric design. By focusing on creating familiarity with worthy design concepts through practical prototyping, the course aims to spark pragmatic imagination for future technologies. This approach seeks to craft optimistic futures that balance technological advancement with human and environmental needs, ultimately reshaping how we perceive and interact with emerging technologies.

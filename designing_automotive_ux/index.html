<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Designing user interfaces for autonomous and connected cars presents unique challenges that differ from traditional digital products or interactive spaces. While ample resources exist for designing apps or museum exhibitions, there is a scarcity of information on creating user interfaces specifically tailored for cars, especially those where the driver relinquishes control and the vehicle remains continuously connected to the web.</p>
<p>This article provides an exclusive glimpse into NIO's UI/UX process, revealing how their team approached the task of designing for this unexplored domain. The discussion encompasses the entire design journey, shedding light on the company's future product designs. With the advent of emerging technologies such as fast mobile internet and autonomous capabilities, the car has transformed into a user experience platform that encompasses productivity, entertainment, and lifestyle domains.
The interior experiences of these cars are shaped by the fusion of the physical and digital worlds, with the Tesla Model 3 serving as a remarkable example of this transition. Designers face the critical decision of determining which experiences should be fully digitized while preserving physical touchpoints to cater to human sensory needs. Achieving harmony between the physical, sensory, and digital realms requires a dynamic trial and error process, skillfully navigating engineering constraints and carefully considering user needs and expectations.</p>
<p>In addition to exploring the design of car interiors, this article underscores a novel approach to designing for new &quot;canvases&quot; where interfaces, both for input and output, are yet to be defined. By delving into the intricacies of this design process, it offers valuable insights for industry professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts alike who are eager to shape the future of user experience in autonomous and connected cars.</p>

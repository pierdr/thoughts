<p>Published <a href="https://medium.com/@pierdr/the-age-of-complexity-1e342ba0fc1d">on Medium<a> as a reaction to the Microsoft/Crowdstrike outage that left a lot of passengers stranded and unable to take their flights because of technical failures.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
In our increasingly complex technological landscape, we face a paradox: the &quot;smart&quot; systems designed to simplify our lives often introduce new layers of intricacy. From business operations to personal relationships, our dependence on these interconnected technologies grows, yet so does the risk of systemic failures. Recent incidents, like the Microsoft-Crowdstrike episode, hint at the challenges ahead, especially as AI integration accelerates. This mounting complexity, while potentially beneficial, also leaves us vulnerable to unforeseen consequencesâ€”data loss, extended downtimes, or security breaches. As systems theory suggests, the more intricate our networks become, the higher the likelihood of breakdown. To navigate this evolving terrain, we must prioritize transparency, resilience, and local-first approaches in system design. By creating technologies that can be &quot;peeled open&quot; and understood, we can build a more robust foundation for 21st-century innovations, ensuring our digital infrastructure can withstand the tests of an unpredictable future.</p>

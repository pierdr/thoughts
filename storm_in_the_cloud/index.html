“Data is the new oil” has become a slogan since The Economist published a provocative article on this topic in May 2017. The article talks about how the 5 big tech giants might be compared to the monopolies of the past, especially oil giants. In tech jargon pipelines of data, like pipelines of oil, transfer the unrefined material from the creator, the user, to the beneficiary, the tech corporation, and like the oil giants, that material is refined and reused to empower and enable recommendations, shopping suggestions, metrics, inventory management, commerce etc.. It just exploits consumers (and the environment too, building large data centers is not cheap nor free of pollution); people have little influence on how the data they generate is used. While there might be many arguments in favor of the services offered, from one-day delivery to free internet search, the downside is the power of these companies in controlling data and exploiting users most humane vulnerabilities of ease, convenience and excitement. People’s data leaks, like oil, it show the lack of care and and lack of privacy of these systems, like big oil companies also have leaks, showing their disregard for the environment and local communities. Tech companies involved in large language models and artificial intelligence are hungry for data, their primary element that can be refined into large language models, generative images, and who knows what more. AI-generated TV shows, ai generated books, novels, art… the list doesn’t seem to have a limit. All of this is possible because these companies are reaching an even deeper level of exploitation and lack of ethics, they are farmers of data in the open web. </p>

The idea of human as farmed object is made explicit and visceral in the film, The Matrix, and while in the film the good extracted is the warmth and energy of human physiology, the AI revolution is farming human ingenuity. Some of us believed in the open web where spirit of collaboration and collective dreaming made us write blogs, input wikipedia articles, scan analog resources and made them available to the world, over the open web. The reward for sharing time and energy in the open web sometimes is just a thank you, some other is the fame within the local collective of the forum, or it's just being the virtual major of a place. The idea that someone is just taking all of it and productize it, selling it, discounting it, remixing it, for the sake of creating a yet another disruptive technology, that ultimately benefits the few disruptors, the investors, the CEOs and few others. Is the majority just going to accept it? If we look at the oil industry, they have been extracting value from the land and the seas and the taxpayers money ( a great deal of incentives!) and they rarely share profits, let alone make reparations for the damage they have caused, that will be long lasting. The majority doesn’t even understand what is happening, what can be lost and consequently the majority will not have a chance to steer this technology in a direction that could benefit them. 
Extractors are not going to pay back reparations for the predatory capture of content in the open web; people's ingenuity has been exploited, yet again. 
<p>I feel betrayed too.</p>
